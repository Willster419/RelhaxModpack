  -create RelHaxConfigs dir if not already there on startup

  -for each mod, if checked, save it's name and config
  -for loading, if mod exists and is enalbed, check it, and it's config

(enhancement) have it uninstall only the mods installed
  -save the old patch folders somehow
  -keep a log of every extracted zip entry
  delete every file in the log (if it exists)
