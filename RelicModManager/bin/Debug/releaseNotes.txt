-We have (hopefully) fixed an issue where the application will delete itself. It was a weird bug to say the least
-In the OMC view, the content has been vertically allighed to the check boxes and buttons
-There is now a search feature where you can search for your mod, and the installer will open the tab and scroll to where it is in the list. The first modpack with a search feature!
-The patching system has been re-worked for giving the ability to order the patching process in the same way that the mods are installed
-Added an additional check to verify the integrity of the local cached database. If invalid it will delete it
-Fixed a bug in the default view where panel colors would not be set properly
-Fixed a bug where in the auto install mode, the application would still present a window for deleting old files
-Added the ability to embed youtube (or other) videos into the database, as if it was a picture. An example of this can be seen in the "sound mods" tab->Relhax
-Other back-end tools fixes
-Other bug fixes
-Updated translations
