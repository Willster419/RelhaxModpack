You can get the logs in one of two ways:

  - click on "Diagnostic Utilities" in the upper left corner
  - a new window appears called "Diagnostics"
  - click on "Collect all log files into a zip file to report a problem"
  - again a new window appears called "add selection and pictures" (- only additionaly: add selectionfiles or 
     screenshots to report)
  - just click on "Continue" and the zip-file will be created on your desktop
  - upload the zip-file here or join our discord
- fetch files manually: in detail:
  - \Relhax\ <- that´s the directory where you have installed the RelhaxModpack.exe 
  - \Relhax\RelHaxLog.txt \Relhax\RelHaxSettings.xml
  - \Relhax\RelHaxUserConfigs\lastInstalledConfig.xml 
  - \World_of_Tanks\ <- the directory where you have installed WoT
