- Re-worked the dependency calculation system. Before, it would process based on the entire dependency list, with the sub-process being the refrences in the database.
- Now, the calculation is based on the refrences, which have the sub-process to lookup from the list. This allows for logging and reporting of broken dependency references, as well any dependencies not used.
